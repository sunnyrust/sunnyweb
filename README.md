## Introduction
This is my personal web server program.I had to make it public so that I can share it with others.
I had try to make it third time.This time I will try to make it better.
## Requirements
    Rust 、HTML5、CSS3、JavaScript

## What is this Crate?
It is a simple web server.
You can use it to write your own web pages.It is written in Rust. It is based on the Tokio crate and Axum crate.
### Command line app
It has a simple command line app.It is written in Rust and very simple to use.I named it Lychee.
Yeap,It is a specification.
It is a technique supported by some model-view-controller frameworks, in which the programmer may write a specification that describes how the application database may be used. The compiler uses this specification to generate code that the application can use to create, read, update and delete database entries, effectively treating the template as a "scaffold" on which to build a more powerful application.

## How to use it?
1.Install rust.
